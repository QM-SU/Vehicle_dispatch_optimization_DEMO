# Vehicle_dispatch_optimization_DEMO

"A Dynamic Rebalancing Strategy of Shared Autonomous Vehicles Considering the Uncertainty of Demand Prediction"

The files provide Python implementation examples and the required data for the optimization process, the SAA method, and the method to evaluate the quality of the approximate solutions (based on scenarios at 8:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 22:00). 

The primary execution files are named "Main_08am," "Main_12pm," "Main_18pm," and "Main_22pm," while the file titled "Vehicle_dispatch_optimization_model" contains the function for the optimization process. The necessary data files include "Data for Example_08am," "Data for Example_12pm," "Data for Example_18pm," and "Data for Example_22pm." When executing the program, please ensure that you update the paths in the main execution files as directed.
